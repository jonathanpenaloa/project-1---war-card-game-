link to app game - 

1. The cards will be split in two deck of 26 cards when user clicks "Lets Play" button.

2. The cards that show up will represent Player's hand and Computer's card.

3. Winner Card will take both cards and Add them to their deck.

4. When pleyer card and Computer Cards are the same, "WAR" starts.

5. Three cards from each deck will be offered in War mode - the winner of the next hand will take WAR cards to their deck.

6. Game will end once all the cards are all in one deck Player/Computer.
 


☐ Next Steps: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).

- I want to add animation that will show the War cards somewhere else in the screen. Then add them to the winners deck. 

- I would like to add sound the plays when you deal cards.

- Change the background to represent when game inters War.
